> According to information from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), there are 30,000 to 40,000 deaths in traffic accidents in the United States in a year. The analysis of traffic accident data in the United States presents an opportunity to gain valuable insights into the factors contributing to road safety and accident occurrence. In this project, we delve into a comprehensive dataset encompassing various variables related to traffic accidents across the nation.

> We now have the tools to identify important patterns and trends from this enormous information thanks to the development of big data analytics. Through the utilization of sophisticated analytical methods, our objective is to detect underlying trends, identify risk variables, and create models for prediction that will help in improving traffic management systems and devising focused safety measures.

> We  utilized methodologies such as exploratory data analysis and machine learning algorithms. Our aim is to simplify the understanding of road safety, facilitating informed decision-making and ultimately contributing to a safer transportation environment for all.

> As we navigate through the dataset, our objective is to highlight the potential of big data analytics in reshaping the future of road safety initiatives. By unraveling hidden insights within the data, we endeavor to pave the way towards a transportation ecosystem that is safer and more resilient.

> For this project, we used the [US Accidents dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents) from Kaggle. It covers accidents that occurred in the United States from 2016 to 2023.

> We implemented our project using <ins>**Python**</ins> on <ins>**Intellij IDEA**</ins>. We used <ins>**Apache Spark**</ins> for the development of the project and this has been a great benefit. Because it would have taken much more time to process and graph a large data of 3 GB without spark. Spark shortened this time considerably for us. We also used <ins>**Pandas</ins>** for our project because it is an easy-to-use and efficient data analysis tool. It is successful in managing large datasets. However, the main purpose of using Pandas is to visualize the data more easily.

> Accident severity prediction was done in Alameda County, California. <ins>**Logistic Regression**</ins>, <ins>**Decision Tree**</ins>, and <ins>**Random Forest**</ins> models are employed. The data is preprocessed and analyzed to evaluate the performance of each model.
